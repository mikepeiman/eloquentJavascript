was curious, so I looked up maximum size of an array (like, what can you do with them?)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6154989/maximum-size-of-an-array-in-javascript
About 4.29 billion elements. 
This is great, because as EloquentJavascript says, 
"A set of daily log entries can be represented as an array",
and LifeIQ will in many ways be similar to a large collection of daily log entries.
