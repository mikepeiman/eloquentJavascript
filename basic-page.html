<!-- What I want to accomplish as a very simple app is to ask the user how many elements are in this set.
On submit, that many text inputs are generated to input the element names... even as I write that I realize it is
clunky and crude. One form input, enter an element name, repeat until you have entered all your elements. Simple.
